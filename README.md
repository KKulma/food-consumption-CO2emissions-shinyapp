# food-consumption-CO2emissions-shinyapp
A shiny app visualising FAO data on annual food-consumption-related CO2 emissions per person for 130 nations (in 2013). 

The data was published on [nu3 website](https://www.nu3.de/blogs/nutrition/food-carbon-footprint-index-2018).

I described how to scrape and tidy the data up in [this blog post](https://r-tastic.co.uk/post/from-messy-to-tidy/).
